# loki v1.2 Release Notes

Source: [v1.2.0](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

One week has passed since the last Loki release, and it's time for a new one!

### Notable Changes

We have continued our work making our API Prometheus-compatible. The key
changes centered around API compatibility are:

* [1370](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/1370) **slim-bean**: Change `/loki/api/v1/label` to `loki/api/v1/labels`
* [1381](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/1381) **owen-d**: application/x-www-form-urlencoded support

Meanwhile, @pstibrany has done great work ensuring that Loki handles hash
collisions properly:

* [1247](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/1247) **pstibrany**: pkg/ingester: handle labels mapping to the same fast fingerprint.

As always, the full list of changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/v1.2.0/CHANGELOG.md)!
